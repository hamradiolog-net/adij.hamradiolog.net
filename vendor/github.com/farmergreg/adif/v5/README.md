# ⚡ High Performance ADI Parser for Go

This library provides high-performance processing of [ADIF](https://adif.org/) (Amateur Data Interchange Format) ADI files used for ham radio logs.
It's idiomatic, developer-friendly API seamlessly integrates with your codebase and the go standard library.

## ✨ Features

- 🔬 **Tested**: 100% test coverage!
- 🔧 **Developer Friendly**: Clean, idiomatic, mock friendly interfaces
- 🚀 **Blazing Fast**: 2.4x-20x faster than [other libraries](https://github.com/farmergreg/adif-benchmark)
- 💡 **Memory Efficient**: Uses 2.2x less memory and makes 3.8 fewer allocations than the nearest competitor.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
go get github.com/farmergreg/adif/v5
```

1) [ADI Processing Example](./example_adi_test.go)
2) ADX XML Processing: Not implemented. PR(s) welcome!
3) [JSON Processing Example](./example_json_test.go): Experimental. Not optimized; not part of the ADIF Specification.

## Benchmarks

Please see the [Go ADIF Parser Benchmarks](https://github.com/farmergreg/adif-benchmark) project for benchmarks.

TLDR, this library processes ADI data 3x faster than the go standard library can process the same data in json format.
This library is 2.4x faster than the nearest ADI parser.

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive (ADI Parser)

The ADI parser in this library achieves high performance through the following optimizations:

### Performance Optimizations

- Leverages stdlib I/O operations with SSE/SIMD acceleration depending upon your CPU architecture
- Smart buffer pre-allocation based on discovered record sizes
- Optimized base-10 integer parsing for ADIF field lengths

### Memory Management

- Zero-copy techniques minimize memory operations
- String interning of repeated field names greatly reduces copying, allocations, and memory use
- Minimal temporary allocations during field parsing
- Dynamic buffer sizing based on learned field counts
- Buffer pooling
